# Ozone
This project uses the AirNow API to look up the air quality index (AQI) by zip code. The AQI was developed by the EPA
and calculates scores based on levels of ozone, air particle pollution, and other pollutants. 

## AQI Scale
The application takes a zip code and displays a score of the AQI rating and a color coded categories corresponding to the 
[chart](https://docs.airnowapi.org/aq101) on the AirNow website.
